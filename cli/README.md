# Motivation for this CLI

This CLI acts as a workflow accelerator.

One could run all its commands manually, e.g. by running the respective playbook.
However, using the CLI one avoids the need to memorize lengthy commands and easy to mistype options.

For now this CLI is only used during local development - It can be easily integrated into the CI.

# Installation
See the Makefile.
