# NOTE: This is an auxiliary workaround hosts group to overcome linter challenges.
# The linter does not recognize externally (AWX) injected variables and thinks they are undefined,
# even with a checker role/play to handle them before a play.
# Just setting the missing host value to "" or "... | default('')" does not work because Ansible/Linter requires non-empty hosts.
